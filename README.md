I love to code for fun, but there is so much growth for me in my job that I often do not find enough time to continue my growth outside of work. I know that it is important and more than that there is a lot I want to do. It is time to take that into my own hands.

*If not know, then when?*

My plan to increase my personal growth, involves the following: 

1. 10 minutes language 
2. 10 minutes algorithm
3. 10 minutes on your project
4. 10 minutes reading 
5. 10 minutes stretching
6. 10 minutes writing about the experience and your day - include the best thing that happened that day 
7. 10 minutes on [The Delectable Feast](http://thedelectablefeast.com)
